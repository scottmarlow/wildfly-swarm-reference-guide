# `usage.txt`

Each WildFly Swarm application may contain a text file at 
one of the following locations:

* `/usage.txt`
* `/META-INF/usage.txt`
* `/WEB-INF/usage.txt`

If found, once the application has fully started, then the
file will be logged with variable substitution from the
configuration properties.

## Variable substitution

Variables within the `usage.txt` file of the format `${swarm.thing}`
will be replaced with their current value.  This may be useful for
display the currently active port used by the application, for instance
by having content such as:

    The application is now ready on ${swarm.http.port}!
