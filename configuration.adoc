# Configuration of a WildFly Swarm Application

Every application built with WildFly Swarm has a vast
variety of configurable options.  In all cases, reasonable
defaults are already applied, and you only need concern 
yourself with those particular items you wish to 
explicitly change from their default values.

This _Reference Guide_ serves as a complete index of all
configurable items, separated by the fraction which introduces
them.  Only items related to the fractions involved in 
your application are pertinent to your application.

## Using Properties

Within this document, the configuration items are presented
using dotted notation, and are suitable for use as Java property
names, provided to your application through explicit setting
via the Maven plugin or through the command-line when executing
your application.

Any property that has _KEY_ listed in its name indicates that
a user-supplied key or identifier should be used in that segment
of the name.

For instance, the configuration item documented as
`swarm.undertow.servers.KEY.default-host` indicates that the
configuration applies to a particular named server.  In actual
usage, the property would be something such as
`swarm.undertow.servers.default.default-host`, applying to the
server known as `default`.


### Properties via Maven Plugin

If you wish to set explicit configuration values to be baked
in as defaults through the Maven plugin, in your `pom.xml`
you would add a `<properties>` section to the plugin's
`<configuration>`.

For instance, the configuration item of `swarm.bind.address`
is set through the plugin.

[source,xml]
----
<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.wildfly.swarm</groupId>
      <artifactId>wildfly-swarm-plugin</artifactId>
      <configuration>
        <properties>
          <swarm.bind.address>127.0.0.1</swarm.bind.address>
          <java.net.preferIPv4Stack>true</java.net.preferIPv4Stack>
        </properties>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
----

Note: We generally recommend not using the Maven plugin to 
explicitly set properties to control configuration. The YAML
method, described further below, is the preferred method.

### Properties via the Command-Line

While setting properties via the Maven plugin is not recommended,
it is often useful to temporarily change a configuration item
for a given launching of your application. This may be to customize
some environment-specific setting, or to experiment with some
configuration items before committing them to YAML.

To use a property via the command-line, you simply pass
them as you would any other Java process:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -Dswarm.bind.address=127.0.0.1 -jar myapp-swarm.jar
----

## Using YAML

YAML is the preferred method for long-term configuration of
an application. Additionally, the YAML strategy provides for
grouping together of environment-specific configurations which
can be selectively enabled when launching the application.

### General format

In the configuration names within this _Reference Guide_,
a YAML structure can be derrived.  

For instance, the item described `swarm.undertow.servers.KEY.default-host`
would translate to the following YAML, substituting the identifier
of `default` for the `KEY` segment:

[source,yaml]
----
swarm:
  undertow:
    servers:
      default:
        default-host: <myhost>
----

### Default YAML Files

If your application's original `.war` contains a file named `project-defaults.yml`,
that file represents the defaults applied overtop the absolute defaults that
WildFly Swarm provides to your application.

Additionally, if specific configurations are selected, using the `-S <name>` 
commandline option, those associated files will be loaded, in order, prior to the
`project-defaults.yml` file. The names provided to the `-S <name>` argument
relates to a file named `project-<name>.yml` within your classpath.

If you were to invoke your application with the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -jar myapp-swarm.jar -Stesting -Scloud
----

Then the relevant YAML files would be loaded in the following preference
order, where the first one containing a given configuration item wins:

. `project-testing.yml`
. `project-cloud.yml`
. `project-defaults.yml`

### Non-default YAML Files

In some events, you may wish to reference a YAML file of configuration
values that it _outside_ of your application.  In that case, the `-s <path>`
command-line option may be used.

Files loaded by the `-s <path>` option take precedent over any default
YAML file contained within your application.  Both `-s <path>` and `-S <name>`
may be freely used concurrently, but be aware that all `-s <path>` options
are considered to have higher precedent over `-S <name>` options.

For instance, if you were to invoke your application with the following:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -jar myapp-swarm -s/home/app/openshift.yml -Scloud -Stesting
----

Then the relevant YAML files would be loaded in the following order:

. `/home/app/openshift.yml`
. `project-cloud.yml`
. `project-testing.yml`

The same preference would be applied even if the application was invoked
using:

[source,shell]
----
$ java -jar myapp-swarmm -Scloud -Stesting -s/home/app/openshift.yml
