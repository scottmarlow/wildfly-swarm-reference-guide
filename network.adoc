# Network 

For network configuration, *interfaces*, *socket-bindings* and *outbound-socket-bindings*
may be created or adjusted. The networking configuration is under the `network` key underneath
the core `swarm` key.

## Interfaces

An interface represents a known ethernet interface. By default the interface named
`public` is bound to the IP address of `0.0.0.0` which represents all known interfaces
of the underlying machine. This includes publicly-routed interfaces and the localhost
`127.0.0.1` interface.

Additionally, when the `management` fraction is included in an application, an
interface named `management` is also provisioned, which is bound to only the
localhost `127.0.0.1` address.

To configuration an additional interface, bound to `192.168.4.5` for instance:

    swarm:
      network:
        interfaces:
          backnet:
            bind: 192.168.4.5

If you wish to change the bind address for the public or management interfaces,
special, easier-to-use properties are defined for those two cases:

By setting `swarm.bind.address` or `swarm.management.bind.address` (or their related
YAML values), the underlying address used by each can be changed.

## Sockets

_Socket-bindings_ and _outbound-socket-bindings_ allow for externalized configuration
of sockets (and ports) bound to a particular interface. Regular socket-bindings are
for inbound connections, while outbound-socket-bindings denote connections capable
of being made to remote locations.

### Socket-Binding Groups

Groups of bindings occur within _socket-binding-groups_, with the default group
being named `standard-sockets`. An entire group's sockets can be bound to a given
default interface, or all members of the group may be offset by a particular
number of ports.

    swarm:
      network:
        socket-binding-groups:
          standard-sockets:
            port-offset: 10
            default-interface: public

### Socket- Bindings

Socket-bindings may be created or adjusted within a `socket-binding-group`:

    swarm:
      network:
        socket-binding-groups:
          standard-sockets:
            http:
              port: 8081

### Outbound Socket-Bindings

To create a named outbound socket-binding for connection to remote endpoints,
`outbound-socket-bindings` may be defined within a `socket-binding-group`:

    swarm:
      network:
        socket-binding-groups:
          standard-sockets:
            outbound-socket-bindings:
                  neo4jtesthost:
                    remote-host: localhost
                    remote-port: 7687
